            <p>
                I am an ambitious and naturally curious software developer with a background working
                in a multidisciplinary team as a Physiotherapist with high-performance athletes in
                the Bulgarian National ski team. My strong analytical and organisational skills due
                to my background as a diagnostic practitioner and my desire for knowledge made the
                decision to move into Software Development very straightforward. Currently enrolled
                in CodeClan Professional Software Development training, I am looking forward to
                joining the Scottish tech ecosystem.
